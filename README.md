<h2>About</h2>

<h3>Project Brief</h3>
<p>A veterinary practice has approached you to build a web application to help them manage their animals and vets. A vet may look after many animals at a time. An animal is registered with only one vet.</p>
<h4>MVP</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The practice wants to be able to register / track animals. Important information for the vets to know is:
      <ul>
        <li>Name</li>
        <li>Date Of Birth (use a VARCHAR initially)</li>
        <li>Type of animal</li>
        <li>Contact details for the owner</li>
        <li>Treatment notes</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Be able to assign animals to vets</li>
    <li>CRUD actions for vets / animals</li>
   </ul>
   
 <h4>Possible Extensions</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Mark owners as unregistered.  Unregistered owners can't add animals </li>
  <li>Owners can have multiple animals</li>
  <li>Add search bar to index.html pages to find animals/owners quickly</li>
  <li>Sort animals/owners alphabetically</li>
  <li>Add CRUD functionality for appointments and treatments</li>
   <li>Vets/animals display upcoming appointments arranged by date.  Also, display past appointments for animals so we can see their treatment history.</li>
  </ul>
